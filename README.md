# Platforms

This project was developed in my fourth semester in a computer graphics course. A fellow student implemented the puppet and its animation and I did pretty much the rest of it. This project is based on an introduction on openGL.


Controls:

W,A,S,D - Walk
SPACE - Jump
Mouse - turn around

C - switch between first/third person mode

N - new game
H - switch speed mode
T - change platform texture


If you want to cheat:
ENTER - fly up
RIGHT SHIFT - fly down
LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN ARROW - move without gravity
