Window Object is now declared at the beginning and initialized later

Mouse Object is created at the beginning
-> as soon as the windows gets initialized, the mouse objects needs to be told its window object
processMouseMove(); has to go into the loop

//glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_STICKY_KEYS, 1);


playerObject.setCamera(&c);

PLATFORM-COLLISION DETECTION:
1. create CollisionDetector Object
3. create Platforms and call collDetObj.addPlatform(&pltfrm);
4. ask CollisionDetector Object whether a coordinate collides with Platforms (collDetObj.collision(glm::vec3 co))
